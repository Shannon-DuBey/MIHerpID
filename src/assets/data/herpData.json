Habitat:  Open woodlands and adjacent meadows, thickets, and gardens, often near shallow ponds, swamps, or streams. Michigan's only truly terrestrial turtle. Habits:  Many Box turtles stay in a small home range (under five acres) most of their lives; they routinely live for several decades, occasionally a century or more. Food includes plants, berries, fungi, insects, worms, slugs, snails, carrion. Reproduction:  Mating can occur spring through fall; female may remain fertile for four years after mating. Three to 8 oval, soft shelled eggs are laid in the ground in June; they hatch in 75 to 90 days. Range and Status:  Uncommon to rare in southern and western Lower Peninsula. Declining due to habitat loss, collecting for pets, and road mortality. Protected by Michigan law as a special concern species.",

     "narrative": "Life History and Michigan History As its scientific name,  , implies, the shell of the wood turtle is one of the most ornate of the turtles in Michigan. A noticeable keel running down the back of the carapace and the pointed edges of the scutes along the back edge add to its sculpted appearance. The yellow on the underparts of its neck, legs, and stomach, plus the highly visible deep circular growth rings of the scutes on the brownish carapace help with identification. The adult carapace length is 6.3 to 9.4 inches (16 to 24 cm). Photo © Jim Harding Wood turtles live in rivers with sandy-bottomed streams and rivers. They spend most of their time in the river from September to May, but in summer can be found foraging in woods, swamps, and meadows in the upland areas edging the stream or river. Logs or banks near water and sunny woodland openings are often utilized for basking. These turtles are omnivores eating a variety of plants and animals and carrion found in and along the river. Wood turtles employ a unique technique to hunt earthworms. Using either an alternating foot stomp, or by lifting and dropping its shell on the ground, they create vibrations in the ground. These vibrations will cause earthworms to surface where they are quickly snatched for a meal. Anglers seeking bait can employ a similar technique. A stick stuck in the ground and wiggled back and forth to create vibrations will cause earthworms to leave the ground. Egg-laying occurs in the sunny areas of exposed river sand banks. Females lay 3-to-18 soft-shelled eggs in a cavity they dig in late-May or June. After about six weeks of incubation in the warm sand, brownish, long-tailed nestlings hatch and head to the water. It may take as many as 20 years before these new hatchlings begin to produce offspring of their own. The population of wood turtles in Michigan has declined in recent years and is considered rare in the northern Lower and Upper Peninsulas. It is protected by Michigan law as a special concern species. Threats include predation by raccoons and skunks. In some areas, egg and hatchling mortality can exceed 80 percent. Water pollution and sedimentation can impact survival of turtles. Reduction of nesting areas through stream bank stabilization has impacted turtle populations in local areas. The commercial pet trade and removal of individual turtles for personal pets has also reduced populations. The future for this relict of the time of dinosaurs is uncertain, but finding solutions to a number of the threats is important in making sure the wood turtle remains part of Michigan's Wildlife Heritage.

Habitat:  Bogs or boggy ponds, fens, sphagnum seepages, and grassy marshes. Prefer shallow, clean water with mud bottom, clumps of sedge or marsh grass. Habits:  A cold tolerant species that becomes active and mates early in spring; often inactive or dormant in hot weather. Begins to decrease activity when water temperatures cool to 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Enters hibernation in muskrat burrows or loafs through the winter on the bottom of pools with flowing water. Has the ability to breathe through the skin when under water. Gill-like tissues filter oxygen from the water directly into blood.

      "narrative": "Life History and Michigan History The tinkling of bells is a popular description of the spring peeper's spring mating call. Spring peepers are one of the earliest callers among the dozen frog species found in Michigan. During the first warm evenings of spring in late March or early April through May, their distinctive single note, high pitched peep is considered a harbinger of spring. The intensity of calling increases and can become a deafening chorus during humid evenings or just after a warm spring rain when many males congregate. Only the male frogs call. They establish territories near the edge of permanent or ephemeral wetlands. They may call from elevated perches of submerged grass or shrubs near the water. The faster and louder a male sings, the more likely he is to attract a mate. Photo andcopy; Jim Harding The female will lay between 750-1,200 eggs. The strings or clumps are attached to twigs and aquatic vegetation. Depending on the temperatures, eggs may hatch within four days or may take up to two weeks during cooler periods. After another two to three months, young tadpoles are fully transformed into young frogs and leave the pond. They resemble their parents with the most distinctive mark being a dark brown X (may be irregular or incomplete on some) on their lighter brown or tan back. They begin feeding on small food items like spiders, mites, ticks, pill bugs, ants, and caterpillars. By the end of the summer, they have reached the adult size of about 1 - 1 1/2 inches. As the days cool, the peepers dig into the soft mud near ponds for the winter. Still, during warm spells into the fall they can be confused and emerge to give their spring mating call. The spring peeper is the most abundant of Michigan's singing frogs and is common statewide. They prefer damp woodlands, swamps, and marshes. However, they still need protection - local populations around small ponds and wetlands can be highly susceptible to surface water runoff. These waters can carry chemicals, pesticides, or silt that can kill adults, eggs, or tadpoles. Good soil erosion practices and the careful application of pesticides and fertilizers are good for spring peepers. It is our responsibility to make sure that we will always be able to open a window on a warm spring night and fall asleep to the tinkle of the spring peeper. Non-DNR Links",

Cricket frogs usually emerge from hibernation in late March to early April and breed from mid-May to mid-July. During the breeding season, males give a distinctive, metallic clicking call, similar to the sound made when two pebbles are tapped together. The female lays eggs singly or in small clusters, which transform into tadpoles in late summer. Blanchard's cricket frogs were once abundant in southern Michigan, but during the late 1970s and early 1980s, many populations in Michigan and the Great Lakes basin declined dramatically or disappeared.

When not breeding, they take refuge under rotting logs and leaf litter. They eat insects and insect larvae, spiders, worms, and other small invertebrates. Breeding:  The female lays her eggs in spring, in a clump of moss, leaf litter, or rotting wood overhanging a pond, creek, or seepage. She usually attends the eggs during the month or two of incubation; occasionally more than one female will lay eggs at the same site. Upon hatching, the larvae drop into the water and complete development, with metamorphosis occurring in about six weeks. Conservation:  The spotty distribution of the Four toed Salamander is probably due to the specialized breeding habitat it requires.

The skin appears rough, but is soft to the touch. Two subspecies merge in Michigan: the Red-spotted Newt ( ) has two rows of black bordered red spots on the back. The smaller Central Newt ( ) may lack red spots, or may have red spots that lack black borders. Adult newts are 2.5 to 5.5 inches (6.4 to 14 cm) long. Photo © Jim Harding Habitat/Habits:  Found state-wide, newts prefer small, permanent ponds, but also live in vernal ponds, sloughs, marshes, bogs, swamps and lake shallows. Efts are usually found in nearby woods, under rotting logs, rocks, and other shelters. Adults are active all year under water, but can hibernate on land if the pond dries up. Insects, worms, crustaceans, mollusks, other small invertebrates, and tadpoles are eaten. Their toxic skin secretions cause many fish to avoid eating them. Breeding:  Adults breed in late winter and early spring. Courtship is elaborate, with much nudging, twitching, and tail fanning by the male. Females attach up to 300 single eggs to underwater plants or debris in April. In late summer, the gill breathing larvae may transform directly into the aquatic adult stage or become efts that live on land for a year or two before returning to the water. Conservation:  Newts can be locally common in Michigan, but rarely achieve the high densities seen in some eastern and southern states. Newts disappear when habitats are degraded or polluted. They may benefit from construction of artificial ponds, especially if predatory fish are not introduced.",

The light, silvery  markings form cross-bands that run the length of the back and may merge into a stripe on each side. Adults are 3.5 to 5 inches (9 to 12.7 cm) long. Photo andcopy; Jim Harding Just about the time most other amphibians are looking for places to winter hibernate, marbled salamanders are heading to breeding areas. The only fall breeding salamander, they seek out small areas (micro habitats) with temperatures around 60anddeg;F. The female will lay an average of 100 eggs in a nest constructed in a shallow depression under leaf litter or in a log. The female remains with the eggs until fall rains fill the nest site. Eggs will hatch within two weeks. In mild winters, larvae can feed and grow and transform in late spring or early summer. If the nest site does not flood, eggs will go dormant until the following spring. The salamander larvae that do not hatch in fall metamorphose into terrestrial adults in late spring or June or July. Uniquely, Marbled Salamanders breed in fall instead of spring. Females lay eggs in depressions under leaf litter or logs, in low spots that fill with fall rains. The habitat they select varies with the season. During the spring and summer, the adults spend their time in sandy upland deciduous forests. They seek shelter under logs or in underground tunnels of other animals. Their diet consists of earthworms, insects, slugs, and other small invertebrates; the larvae often eat the larvae of other amphibians. In autumn, they congregate in groups near lowland forested habitat to breed. The marbled salamander is a nocturnal, secretive creature that is rarely, if ever seen. The Michigan population is restricted to scattered populations in southwestern counties. It is more widely found in southeastern United States. In Michigan, the marbled salamander is currently listed as threatened due primarily to habitat fragmentation, wetland drainage, channelization, and filling. It has not been reported in Michigan for many years, and may be extirpated. Since shallow woodland ponds often freeze completely during typical winters, it is likely that the fall breeding habits of this species are not well adapted to Michigan's present climate. The survival of this species in Michigan will rely on identification and conservation of sites found to have marbled salamander populations. Since they migrate to their breeding areas, it will also be important to identify migration routes that may cross roadways. Recovery at these sites will require safe passage between forested uplands and lowland intermittent pools. Report any Michigan sightings of this species to the DNR Wildlife Division. ",

This salamander found throughout Michigan is common in moist deciduous hardwood areas and swamp woodlands, preferably with access to vernal ponds. However, they often persist in drier, human disturbed second growth woodlands. Their diet includes insects, spiders, worms, and other small invertebrates. Their coloration can vary but generally they are black with turquoise or pale blue flecks and spots on the sides, limbs, belly, and tail. The belly may be black or grayish black. Adults average about 3.5 to 5.5 inches (8.9 to 14 cm) long. Photo andcopy; Jim Harding Note: Across much of Lower Michigan, populations of Blue spotted Salamanders often include many hybrid individuals that may appear stouter and grayer, with fewer or no blue spots on the sides. Most hybrids are triploid females. (Normal salamanders are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes in their body cells; triploid salamanders have an extra set). Hybrid populations result from the breeding of Blue-spotted Salamanders with other members of the  Ambystoma  genus. Like most salamanders blue-spotted salamanders breed during the first warm spring rains of March and April. One of the best times to view salamanders is just after the ice melts in the vernal (forest ponds) wetlands. They can often be seen near the edge of the pond. After a brief courtship females will attach egg masses containing about a dozen fertile eggs onto submerged debris. One female can lay up to 500 eggs a year. See the section on breeding in  Michigan's Salamanders  for more details. One of the most interesting adaptations of this species is its defense posture. When danger is sensed the blue-spotted salamander's tail lashes back and forth and produces a noxious secretion from two glands at the base of its tail. Even if the predator gets by this defense it may only end up a small morsel. When grabbed the salamander's tail will detach. While the predator is detained by the writhing tail the salamander zips off to safety. In time a new tail will grow to replace the lost one. Blue spotted Salamanders are fairly common, and even occur in some of the larger urban parks and farm woodlots. They seem to be more tolerant of human habitat disturbance than the related Spotted Salamander, with which they are sometimes confused. They depend on fishless vernal ponds for breeding.

Historically, they could be found in a variety of wetlands and nearby upland woods throughout the lower peninsula. During the late spring, these snakes move from their winter hibernation sites, such as crayfish chimneys and other small mammal burrows in swamps and marshlands, to hunt on the drier upland sites - likely in search of mice and voles, their favorite food. Females give birth to 8 to 20 young in late summer. The young snakes have a single button on their tails; a new rattle segment is added at each shedding of the skin, which occurs several times per year. The massasauga can be characterized as a shy, sluggish snake. Its thick body is colored with a pattern of dark brown slightly rectangular patches set against a light gray-to-brown background. Occasionally, this coloration can be so dark as to appear almost black. The belly is mostly black. It is the only Michigan snake with segmented rattles on the end of its tail and elliptical, (cat like) vertical pupils in the eyes. The neck is narrow, contrasting with the wide head and body and the head appears triangular in shape. Adult length is 2 to 3 feet. These rattlesnakes avoid confrontation with humans; they are not prone to strike - preferring to leave the area when they are threatened. Like any animal though, these snakes will protect themselves from anything they see as a potential predator. Their short fangs can easily puncture skin and they do possess a potent venom. It is best to treat them with respect and leave them alone. The few bites that occur to humans often result from attempts to handle or kill the snakes. Any bite from a massasauga should receive prompt professional medical attention.  When compared to other rattlesnakes found in the United States, the massasauga is the smallest and has the least toxic venom. Massasaugas are found throughout the Lower Peninsula, but not in the Upper Peninsula (thus there are no poisonous snakes on the Upper Peninsula mainland.) They are becoming rare in many parts of their former range, throughout the Great Lakes area, due to wetland habitat loss and persecution by humans. They are listed as a species of special concern by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and are protected by state law.  Like many snakes, the first human reaction may be to kill the snake. But it is important to remember that all snakes play an important role in the ecosystem. Some may eat insects, others like the massasauga consider rodents a delicacy and help control their population. Snakes are also a part of a larger food web and can provide food to eagles, herons, and several mammals. We can easily learn to live with these creatures. When you encounter a snake, leave it alone. In most cases, the snake will move to different areas. If pets are in the area, it is important to confine them until the snake moves on. Most often snakes do not wander into areas with little vegetation. The most likely period to encounter snakes in the open is early spring or mornings when they can be found sunning themselves. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is currently evaluating the Great Lakes population to determine whether it should be listed as a threatened species. In Michigan, it remains an important part of our natural history. Was that a massasauga? Status: Special Concern, it is protected by the State of Michigan and is a candidate for federal listing Range: Entire Lower Peninsula,. Although once common, populations may be declining due to loss of wetland habitats and human harassment. Habitat: During spring, Massasaugas use open shallow wetlands or shrub swamps. They can be found in crayfish towers or small animal burrows which are adjacent to drier upland open shrub forest sites. During summer, Massasaugas move upland to drier areas. Look for them sunning in open fields, grassy meadows or farmed sites. Behavior: Sluggish, slow moving snake. It may strike if threatened. Benefits: Eastern Massasauga rattlesnakes eat small mammals, amphibians and insects. The Massasaugas are eaten by eagles, herons and some mammals. Description: Massasaugas have thick bodies with colors that range from gray, grayish brown or brown. Its back has large dark brown blotches with smaller lighter brown patches on its sides. Young Massasaugas are similarly marked with brighter coloration. This snake has a wide triangular head and eyes with slit shaped pupils. Adults can be 18 to 30 in length. Young Massasaugas have small yellow buttons or rattles at the tip of their tail. Adult rattles are grayish yellow, like pieces of corn kernels, on top of dark rings. Snakes may bite to protect themselves. Look alike Snakes: Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake ( ) Photo by: James H. Harding Eastern Milk Snake ( ) Photo by: James H.

Radio Tracking Project (photo by Matt Heumann) Beginning the Spring of 2002, researchers used radio telemetry equipment to follow snakes at Indian Springs Metropark in Oakland County. This project is a cooperative effort between the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority (HCMA) and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Telemetry uses a tiny radio transmitter surgically implanted into a snake. The signal is picked up by special monitoring equipment.  There are two primary objectives to the telemetry study. First, we seek clarification of the behavior of massasaugas in areas that include expansive upland open habitats such as old fields and savannahs. Second, we are interested in the behavior of massasaugas in areas of human use and how to manage conflicts between massasauga conservation and human recreation.  Up to 15 massasaugas will be implanted with transmitters. They will be monitored for two activity seasons to study their patterns of movement. Data on habitats the snakes are using and when they're using them will be collected. This work will also reveal corridors used and barriers perceived by the snakes. Work at this southern Michigan site will complement efforts conducted in fens in northern Indiana and in coniferous swamps farther north to provide a broader perspective of habitat needs and massasauga behavior across Michigan.  In addition to clarifying the basic biology of massasaugas, a component of this project will be to identify opportunities to promoting the conservation of the massasauga.  As of early April, seven snakes had been captured for the project. Snakes will be monitored regularly throughout the spring and summer, then periodically in the fall to establish hibernacula. If necessary, additional snakes will be implanted in spring 2003. All snakes will then be monitored in spring and summer 2003. Their transmitters would then be removed. Snakes added to the study that year would be followed to their hibernacula (wintering quarters) and transmitters removed in spring 2004.  The eastern massasauga rattlesnake population has declined throughout its range from western New York and southern Ontario, to Iowa and southward to Missouri. It is either included on lists of endangered and threatened species or watch lists in every state it occurs. The primary causes of its decline are habitat loss and persecution. The USFWS listed the massasauga as a candidate for the federal species list. Since massasauga are more common in Michigan than anywhere else in its range, the Natural Heritage Program has agreed to cooperate in a multi-state planning effort to describe how threats to the species will be minimized. The goal is to assure the long-term protection of massasauga populations and eliminate the need for federal listing. 2002 Survey In order to ensure the long-term survival of Michigan's massasauga, an understanding of the distribution of local populations and critical habitats is necessary. In 2002, Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) conducted surveys in an attempt to gain such an understanding. In winter 2002, Dr. Bruce Kingsbury, professor of biology at Indiana-Purdue University, and graduate student Michelle Standora identified 77 potential core areas for 2002 surveys. These sites, all on publicly-owned lands, were identified based on habitat quality and prior rattlesnake occurrences. MNFI surveyed 40 sites associated with 27 of these core areas in addition to five sites associated with other MNFI projects. A total of 80 rattlesnakes were observed by survey participants. Seven others were observed by outside sources, yielding a total of 87 rattlesnakes from 19 different sites. Of these 19 sites, six were birthing sites consisting of 5 adult females and a total of 28 young-of-the-year. Survey efforts will continue in 2003 with an increased focus on survey gaps and identification of hibernation sites. MNFI also hopes to supplement surveys on public lands with additional surveys on private lands. Non-DNR Links Herp Center  (Indiana-Purdue Univ.

      "narrative": "Life History and Michigan History One of the larger snakes in Michigan, the  copper-bellied water snake can grow to a length of 4-5 feet. Adult snakes are easily identified by their dark brown or black back which contrasts easily with the unmarked reddish-to-orange belly and chin. The young have a blotched pattern which may remain visible in some adult specimens. This snake is extremely rare in Michigan. Its population is so low that it is listed as an endangered species in Michigan. It has also recently been listed by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a nationally threatened species. Photo © Jim Harding The copper-bellied water snake prefers to live near wooded floodplains, shrub wetlands, and adjacent to slow moving rivers. As excellent swimmers, they hunt aquatic species including tadpoles, frogs, salamanders, insect larvae, and crayfish. In the spring, tadpoles seem to be especially tasty to hungry copper-bellied water snakes.  Mating takes place in May, and one to two dozen young are born in September or October. It is one of ten species of snakes that do not lay eggs but bare live young. Habitat for the copper-bellied water snake has declined dramatically. Wetlands drainage and development in preferred habitat has limited distribution to only a few small populations.  It has been found only in the southern third of the Lower Peninsula. Indiscriminate killing of snakes has also been a problem in local areas. It is listed as ENDANGERED by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and is protected by law in the state. Any sightings of adult copperbelly water snakes should be reported to the DNR Wildlife Division in Lansing. Only adults should be reported because young copperbelly water snakes are easily confused with red-bellied snakes. Any sightings should be reported to the DNR Wildlife Division in Lansing. Keeping this species as part of Michigan's natural heritage will require protection of remaining habitat and management of lowland hardwoods. If you find a  copper-bellied water snake, count yourself lucky to be one of a very few to experience this unique heritage species.
